//! Store consumer bookmarks and the partition's applied purge generation.
//!
//! A bookmark records the last consumed offset. The purge marker instead records
//! which reset was applied to this incarnation of the partition. Recovery uses
//! them to restore progress and decide whether a purge must be repeated.
//!
//! Functions ending in `_with_storage` share the persistence sequence between
//! real disk and simulated storage. File sync makes record contents durable;
//! directory sync makes creation, replacement, or deletion durable. Offset callers
//! own that directory sync, while purge marker writes include it before returning.
