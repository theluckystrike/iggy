//! The record that makes a gap in the segment chain legitimate.
//!
//! Recovery derives each segment's bounds from its own bytes, so a gap has no
//! author: the boot re-anchor's planted gap and a lost segment look identical.
//! The re-anchor writes its intent down instead, and the chain guard admits a
//! forward gap only when the far side carries an anchor naming exactly the near
//! side.
//!
//! Written and directory-fsynced BEFORE that segment is created. A crash in the
//! window then leaves an anchor with no segment, which the boot sweep collects;
//! the other order leaves a planted segment with no anchor, which the guard
//! reads as damage on an intact chain.
