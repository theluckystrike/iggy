//! Segment recovery: the boot-time reader for the segment files this crate's
//! writers emit.
//!
//! Previously the bootstrap path borrowed `load_segments` from the legacy
//! server implementation to hydrate persisted segments. That loader
//! reads the legacy 16-byte dense per-message index through
//! `server_common::IndexReader`, but the server persists a 24-byte sparse index
//! ([`crate::IggyIndexWriter`]: one entry per flush, absolute `offset`,
//! `timestamp`, and batch-start `position`). Reading the 24-byte file with the
//! 16-byte parser mis-strides it (the "Index data must be exactly 16 bytes"
//! recovery panic). This module is that writer's matching loader, kept in the
//! same crate and reading the same 24-byte format it emits.
