//! Partition-plane state transfer: the offer a serving primary builds, the
//! receiver session with its disk-spilled segment staging, and the wire
//! codec for the consumer-offset artifact.
//!
//! A rejoining replica whose journal repair proved the gap below the commit
//! floor is unrepairable (`RepairConclusion::FloorRefused`) pulls this
//! partition's retained segments plus its consumer-offset table from the
//! group's caught-up primary, installs them, and hands the live tail back to
//! ordinary journal repair. Artifacts ride the plane-agnostic manifest/chunk
//! protocol from `core/consensus`; everything in this module is the
//! partition-specific payload handling on either end.
