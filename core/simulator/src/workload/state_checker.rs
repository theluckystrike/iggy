//! Cross-replica committed-log equality.
//!
//! The per-tick checks in [`super::invariants`] catch a single replica
//! contradicting itself, and [`super::oracle`] compares committed metadata against
//! the workload's shadow. Neither compares replicas to EACH OTHER, which is the
//! actual consensus property: two replicas that both committed op N must have
//! committed the same op N.
//!
//! Keeps one canonical commit chain and asserts every replica agrees with it
//! wherever they overlap, in BOTH directions of `(commit_a == commit_b) ==
//! (checksum_a == checksum_b)`: same op implies same prepare, and same prepare
//! implies same op, the second of which catches one prepare committing at two log
//! positions. Also asserts the chain is hash-linked (`header_b.parent ==
//! checksum_a`). Recording which replicas reached each op keeps the check provably
//! non-vacuous: a chain nothing was compared against passes silently.
