//! Per-shard frame-drop accounting.
//!
//! [`ShardMetrics`] holds `frame_drops_total{variant, reason}`, bumped wherever
//! a frame is shed instead of delivered -- an inter-shard `try_send` rejected
//! (`Full` / `Disconnected`), a target shard id out of range (`Unroutable`), or
//! a buffer at capacity (`ParkOverflow`):
//! - [`crate::coordinator::ShardZeroCoordinator`] - fd-transfer delegation.
//! - the cross-shard forward closures built in [`crate::builder`].
//! - `IggyShard::try_send_to_target` - consensus and partition frames, labelled
//!   by plane.
//! - `IggyShard::park_if_unmaterialised` - partition frames shed because the
//!   park buffer is at its frame or byte cap.
//! - `IggyShard::retire_parked_frames` - parked frames retired with no client
//!   to answer.
//!
//! The counter uses atomic interior mutability, safe to bump from `!Send`
//! compio reactor contexts. Each shard owns its own instance, and the server
//! exposes every shard's instance through the `[http.metrics]` scrape
//! endpoint via [`ShardMetrics::register`] (one `shard`-labelled
//! sub-registry per shard). Drop-site tracing supplements the counters.

/// `shard_id` is intentionally NOT a label here: each shard owns its own

/// (`reason=park_dropped`), an incarnation rejection, or a routing send the
